# Palindrome or not ?
This Palindrome Checker built with HTML, CSS, and JS is a simple web - based tool that allows users to input a word, phrase, or number and check whether it reads the same forwards and backwards i.e. if it is a palindrome or not.

## 📍Features :
- **Clean and User - Friendly Interface**
  <br>
  The tool uses a minimal design with a soft background color and a centered card - like container, making it visually appealing and easy to use.
  
- **Clear Prompt and Input Field**
  <br>
  The heading “Palindrome or not?” makes the purpose immediately clear. There is a large input box with placeholder text (“Enter something”) that guides the user to input a word, number, or phrase.

- **Interactive Button**
  <br>
  A prominent blue “Check” button allows users to submit their input for palindrome checking in a single click.

- **Instant Feedback Display**
  <br>
  The checker dynamically displays the result below the button after input is submitted.

- **Responsive and Accessible Layout**
  <br>
  The results and controls remain centered and easy to read across different input scenarios.

## 📍Working :
- If the input is a palindrome, the result reads : "input" is a Palindrome.
- If the input is not a palindrome, it displays the result : "input" is not a Palindrome.
- If no input is provided then in that case it will generate a random message asking the user to enter a valid input.
